# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Thoughts on the experience:

* Development was nice.
* I like the functional declaration of components.
* I am not completely sold on JSX - I'd like to try a pure JS framework
* Bundling a component that can be imported was a nightmare.
   * I ran into some mess between webpack, create-react-app, yarn and npm
   * Spent a long time trying to bundle a component to use in another
     app with no joy,
